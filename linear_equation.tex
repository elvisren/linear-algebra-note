\section{Linear Equations}

\subsection{Definitions}

There are 3 elementary row operations on a $m \times n$ matrix $A$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item interchange any two rows
    \item multiply any row by a nonzero scalar
    \item add any scalar multiple of a row to another row
\end{enumerate}

Each operation has an elementary operation $E$ associated with it.


The rank of a matrix $A$ is the rank of $L_A$. So we are defining the rank of a matrix using the rank of a linear transformation. This is sometimes useful because we could use matrix to calculate the rank of a linear transformation.

Using element operations, we could convert a $A$ with rank $r$ into a matrix :
\begin{equation*}
    D = \begin{pmatrix}
        I_r & 0 \\
        0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
